        <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">The narrator, an airplane pilot, crashes in the Sahara desert. 
          The crash badly damages his airplane and leaves the narrator with very little food or water. 
          As he is worrying over his predicament, he is approached by the little prince, a very serious little blond boy who asks the narrator to draw him a sheep. 
          The narrator obliges, and the two become friends. 
          The pilot learns that the little prince comes from a small planet that the little prince calls Asteroid 325 but that people on Earth call Asteroid B-612. 
          The little prince took great care of this planet, preventing any bad seeds from growing and making sure it was never overrun by baobab trees. 
          One day, a mysterious rose sprouted on the planet and the little prince fell in love with it. But when he caught the rose in a lie one day, he decided that he could not trust her anymore. 
          He grew lonely and decided to leave. 
          Despite a last-minute reconciliation with the rose, the prince set out to explore other planets and cure his loneliness.</p>
